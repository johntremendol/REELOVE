		<h3>Pulp Fiction (1994) REVIEW</h3>
		<h4>28th December, 2020</h4>
		<p>
Quentin Tarantino is the Jerry Lee Lewis of cinema, a pounding performer who doesn't care if he tears up the piano, as long as everybody is rocking. His new movie "Pulp Fiction" is a comedy about blood, guts, violence, strange sex, drugs, fixed fights, dead body disposal, leather freaks, and a wristwatch that makes a dark journey down through the generations.

Seeing this movie last May at the Cannes Film Festival, I knew it was either one of the year's best films, or one of the worst.

Tarantino is too gifted a filmmaker to make a boring movie, but he could possibly make a bad one: Like Edward D. Wood Jr., proclaimed the Worst Director of All Time, he's in love with every shot - intoxicated with the very act of making a movie. It's that very lack of caution and introspection that makes "Pulp Fiction" crackle like an ozone generator: Here's a director who's been let loose inside the toy store, and wants to play all night.

The screenplay, by Tarantino and Roger Avary, is so well-written in a scruffy, fanzine way that you want to rub noses in it - the noses of those zombie writers who take "screenwriting" classes that teach them the formulas for "hit films." Like "Citizen Kane," "Pulp Fiction" is constructed in such a nonlinear way that you could see it a dozen times and not be able to remember what comes next. It doubles back on itself, telling several interlocking stories about characters who inhabit a world of crime and intrigue, triple-crosses and loud desperation. The title is perfect. Like those old pulp mags named "Thrilling Wonder Stories" and "Official Detective," the movie creates a world where there are no normal people and no ordinary days - where breathless prose clatters down fire escapes and leaps into the dumpster of doom.

The movie resurrects not only an aging genre but also a few careers.

		<h3>Nocturnal Animals (2016) REVIEW</h3>
		<h4>22th December, 2020</h4>
		<p>
			Nocturnal Animals delivers a double shot of horror and Nabokovian despair: it’s excessive, outrageous, a story within a story about the super-rich and super-poor. Director Tom Ford has adapted Austin Wright’s 1993 novel Tony and Susan, magnifying its cruelties and ironies, and bringing to it a sheen of hardcore porn and pure provocation.

This movie had its premiere at Venice earlier this year, and it was every bit as horribly gripping and intimately upsetting this second time around. But now I was struck by its emphasis on the writer’s brooding, solitary life: the writer for whom autobiographical fiction is therapy and revenge. Watching this film, I found myself wondering how Evelyn Waugh’s first wife felt when she received her copy of A Handful of Dust, and realised exactly how the author felt about her.
			It’s a film with a double-stranded narrative, and it pulls off the considerable trick of making you care about both of its stories equally, something I think The French Lieutenant’s Woman never entirely managed. Clive James once wrote that talk about “levels of reality” never properly acknowledges that one of these levels is really real. But in Nocturnal Animals, these levels are equally powerful, and have an intriguingly queasy, potent interrelation.

The scene is Los Angeles where Susan (Amy Adams) is a successful but disillusioned and unhappily married gallery owner, who abandoned her own ambitions to be an artist, and now specialises in modish, challenging contemporary pieces. And I here admit that the opening, Lynchian images of these are too obviously shocking and parodic, a shortcoming that has to be overlooked due to this film’s overall bravura brilliance.

		<h3>Evil Dead (2013) REVIEW</h3>
		<h4>19th December, 2020</h4>
		<p>
			Evil Dead is the remake of a film that has achieved such cult status among horror aficionados that it was a risky film to make. The path that so many other remakes of 80s horror classics navigated could have been taken, casting pretty people with no real regard for their characters or anything else other than the famous killer and immediate gore gratification, but thankfully… Evil Dead decided instead to balance respect for the classic with a new vision. Often it’s hard to know why a remake was made at all, other than to capitalize on a known horror villain and make a few bucks of course, but Evil Dead is unique in the sea of remakes: it earns the right to exist.

Unlike the original 1981 The Evil Dead, Evil Dead begins with a brief bit of background into the evil book written in human blood and bound in human skin, and a glimpse into some horrific events that took place in the very cabin where a band of 20-somethings settle in for a long weekend. At this point that Evil Dead takes yet another turn from it’s predecessor’s set-up of simply being a Spring Break excursion to an unlikely dilapidated cabin in the woods – this crew is there to support Mia (Jane Levy) in her quest to kick the drug habit once and for all.

When a mass of dead cats are discovered hanging in the basement and a strange package turns up wrapped in plastic and wrapped in barbed wire, the situation turns ugly. The “Book of the Dead” is unleashed, and none of the inhabitants of this rickety rural dwelling will emerge unscathed.

The preferred method of discussing and analyzing film such as Evil Dead is to take that film on it’s merits alone, rather than focusing extensively on a comparison between the film and the prior presentation that inspired it. But… is that really possible with a film based on a classic that has so many passionate fans and such a vaunted reputation? The strengths of this film come from both the adherence to the concepts and activities of the original film and a courageous willingness to step outside of those boundaries and present a new vision of demonic possession. Aside from being the bloodiest and goriest horror movie since Peter Jackson’s Brain Dead, Evil Dead has some great characters in (semi) believable circumstances living through the nightmare of an evil demon with a taste for possession and cutting.
